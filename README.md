# Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

Welcome to the **Learning-HTML-CSS-JS-PHP** repository! This repository serves as my personal space for learning and practicing the fundamental technologies used in web development: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my notes, code samples, and exercises as I explore:
- **HTML** â€“ The structure of web pages
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout design
- **JavaScript** â€“ Client-side interactivity and dynamic behavior
- **PHP** â€“ Server-side scripting and backend development

2. Open the files in a code editor like **VS Code** or **Sublime Text**.
3. Start experimenting with the examples and modifying the code.
4. Run **PHP** scripts using a local server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, or a built-in PHP server).
